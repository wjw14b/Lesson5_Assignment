<h1>Review Project Details:</h1>
<ol>
<li>Open the <b>calendar.htm</b> file, located in the Lesson5_Exercise folder.</li>
<li>In the comment section at the top of the document, type your name and today's date where indicated.</li>
<li>Scroll through the document to familarize yourself with its content.  The <em>article</em> element contains a table consisting of five rows and seven columns.  The cells contain no data.  Each of the 31 <em>td</em> elements that will eventually contain the schedule information has an <em>id</em> value.  You will use these <em>id</em> values to place each array element in the correct cell, in a later step.</li>
<li>Preview the calendar.htm file to view the web page. [Right-click on the file in the Filetree and select 'Preview static'].  The table is displayed as an empty grid!</li>
</ol>
